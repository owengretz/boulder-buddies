# README
 
This repository contains the Unity project files. If you want to play the game, you can do so on Itch.io using [this link](https://owengretz.itch.io/boulderbuddies). I continued working on the game after the game jam with the goal to turn it into a complete game with multiple worlds, but never finished. The project files include these additional changes, but the game on Itch.io does not.
